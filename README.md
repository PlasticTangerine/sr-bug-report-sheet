# Saints Row Bug Report Sheet

## Foreword
This is a compilation of bugs I noticed while playing the game. &nbsp;I have been playing the game since release day with a single character I imported from the Boss Factory. &nbsp;These bugs were noticed on the Epic Games (PC) version of the game running with DirectX 12. &nbsp;All bugs were recorded on game version **1.1.6.4392638**, yet some may have been discovered on earlier versions.

Here are my system specs:
|        |                      |
|--------|----------------------|
| OS     | Windows 10 64bit     |
| CPU    | Intel i7-9700K       |
| Memory | 32GB                 |
| GPU    | GeForce RTX 2080 8GB |

Additionally, the game runs off an HDD. &nbsp;I run a tripple monitor setup, with each monitor set to 1920x1080@144hz. &nbsp;The game is displayed on monitor 1. &nbsp;I use a keyboard and mouse as my input device to play the game.

Here is a video that showcases all of my in game settings: &nbsp;[Streamable Video](https://streamable.com/2al36w)

|06|**'MDI-39m Sixguns'** can get caught in an infinite reload loop when dual wielding if the player only has 1 ammo. &nbsp;You cannot fire the weapons once caught in the reload loop.|[Streamable Video](https://streamable.com/661ut1)|
|07|The reticle for the **'TOGO-13 Sniper Rifle'** will misalign with the scope overlay as the character breathes|[Streamable Video](https://streamable.com/oda07o)|

|09|Hole in the geometry on the **'Saints Tower'**|[Imgur Image](https://i.imgur.com/r5dg28P.png)|
|10|Inconsistent LOD distances when flying. &nbsp;This is super noticable for all Criminal Ventures.|[Streamable Video](https://streamable.com/rniwsr)|
|11|Entering a vehicle when with the **'Dual Wield'** perk will half the ammo regardless if the current ammo is less than a magazine for a single gun. &nbsp;When ammo is halved, you do not get it back.|[Streamable Video](https://streamable.com/0n4xlk)|
|12|Exiting a vehicle with the 'Dual Wield' perk and then instantly entering combat stance with a dual wieldable weapon will only wield a single gun. &nbsp;You must switch weapons in order to dual wield again.|[Streamable Video](https://streamable.com/3fto6n)|
|13|**'Wristband, Buckled'** shows the wrong shop icon and equips the incorrect item. &nbsp;It equips **'Wristband, Buckled (Left)'**|[Imgur Image](https://i.imgur.com/ch1OmdK.png)|
|14|Buying a normal version of an accessory will unlock both right and left versions. &nbsp;Buying a **'left'** specified version of a wrist accessory will only unlock the left version.|[Streamable Video](https://streamable.com/8uhsb1)|
|15|Buying, yet not equipping a clothing item from a store will overwrite all custom settings on the item it replaced. &nbsp;When going into the style menu, the item will list more color slot options than it originally had. &nbsp;The item must be reequipped to fix this.|[Streamable Video](https://streamable.com/8n1fql)|
|16|Previewing underwear in a shop will overwrite the currently equipped underwear, even if you do not have the underwear purchased.|[Streamable Video](https://streamable.com/dewcla)|
|17|Double tapping fire (or spamming fire while the original shot is still in progress) with single shot weapons will queue the next shot. &nbsp;This causes issues if you dodge before the next shot occurs, because as soon as you exit the dodge animation an unintended shot will fire.|[Streamable Video](https://streamable.com/ff8y7l)|
|18|**'Doc Ketchum's Horse'** does not unlock after completing **'Aggressive Recruiting'**|[Streamable Video](https://streamable.com/08j52g)|
|19|**'@TCHA'** side hustle icons do not show on the map for replay after completing all of them. &nbsp;The missions themselves are still functional. &nbsp;I completed all of these at 1 star review difficulty originally.|[Streamable Video](https://streamable.com/1jd3js)|
|20|When using the contacts from the **'KAKTS Radio'** venture after the venture is completed, dialog from the uncompleted venture still plays, along with completion messages when defeating a miniboss. &nbsp;The initial call dialog is not present.|[Streamable Video](https://streamable.com/3pel3z)|
|21|Sometimes the reload animation of the **'TOGO-13 Sniper Rifle'** will not drop the magazine making the character reload the gun with the same magazine|[Streamable Video](https://streamable.com/16yf0o)|
|22|The majority of head customizations will alter facial features|[Streamable Video](https://streamable.com/rs8fvn)|
|23|Wearing a necklace will prevent jackets from being shown in stores. &nbsp;Jackets show up fine in the style menu. &nbsp;I am aware of the message that necklaces should overwrite jackets, yet this is inconsistent.|[Streamable Video](https://streamable.com/v9ai1r)|
|24|The **'Wing It'** challenge does not track properly, making it impossible to complete|[Streamable Video](https://streamable.com/dmrlx3)|
|25|The **'Painted Keg'** collectible has a typo in its hint. &nbsp;It states it is located in **'Rojas Desert North'** when it is actually in **'Rojas Desert South'**|[Streamable Video](https://streamable.com/es8eog)|
|26|There is significant framerate loss when rapidly shooting a wall up close. &nbsp;This really impacts the use of the **'Quantum Aperature'** skill. &nbsp;The video was uploaded at 30fps to stay within filesize limits, the effect is more noticable in game.|[Streamable Video](https://streamable.com/1vsmao)|
|27|Unstable framerate in deserts in areas with high vegetation. &nbsp;This is with 'Adaptive' undergrowth enabled. &nbsp;The video was uploaded at 30fps to stay within filesize limits, the effect is more noticable in game.|[Streamable Video](https://streamable.com/d50sov)|
|28|Incorrect grab points on these walls|[Streamable Video](https://streamable.com/o3dnhw)|
|29|Activating the **'D4TH Blossom'** skill during a reload causes issues with the animation|[Streamable Video](https://streamable.com/j3e0g9)|
|30|Weapons will unequip from the weapon wheel yet remain usable in a bugged state. &nbsp;I do not know the exact cause. &nbsp;I have seen it happen with melee and special weapons.|[Streamable Video](https://streamable.com/ws8wxj)|
|31|There are issues that occur when using no underwear, the game acts as if underwear is still equipped. &nbsp;It is very difficult to explain, yet I think the video provides a good example.|[Streamable Video](https://streamable.com/8k6ldl)|
|32|Underwear options are not saved between game loads if a top/bottom are equipped over the underwear. &nbsp;Possibly related, jackets are not saved if a necklace is equipped. &nbsp;I am aware necklaces are intended to overwrite jackets, yet the game will allow you to overwrite the necklace with a jacket in the style menu.|[Streamable Video](https://streamable.com/2uoev1)|
|33|Playlist app does not play more than 1 song in a custom playlist|[Streamable Video](https://streamable.com/7249lh)|

|38|When dual wielding the **'MDI-39m Sixguns'**, the left gun does not have a shooting animation|[Streamable Video](https://streamable.com/anzk35)|

|41|If you use flow with a non-whole amount of flow, there will be visual glitches with the flow meter|[Streamable Video](https://streamable.com/mzv3th)|
|42|If you use the **'Tough Mother'** skill while you still have some shield left over from a previous use of the skill, your flow will be spent and you will not receive any additional shielding. &nbsp;You can also be charged for using the skill with full shields.|[Streamable Video](https://streamable.com/xecq4z)|
|43|Various transparency priority issues|[Imgur Image](https://i.imgur.com/GmGl3s2.png)|
|44|The **'Axe'** weapon has no standard material|[Imgur Image](https://i.imgur.com/olFLu1n.png)|
|45|Weapons with **'visual mod'** options will not save materal/color/pattern customizations between game loads. &nbsp;If a weapon has no visual mods unlocked, the customizations will save.|[Streamable Video](https://streamable.com/zyruqs)|

|47|Auto aim remains active even when disabled|N/A|
|48|The game does not advance past 97% completion|N/A|
|49|I'm not 100% sure, yet I believe every time a toxic waste truck spawns the geiger counter sound effect plays regardless of your location to the truck. &nbsp;This sound plays alot and it is very annoying.|N/A|
|50|You cannot gain more than 1 bar of police notoriety if you have some gang notoriety. &nbsp;I understand that this may be due to performance, yet understand that I want to go on a 10 notoriety rampage.|[Streamable Video](https://streamable.com/k0x9o2)|
|51|Purchasing and equipping a wingsuit in a shop will leave the wingsuit visible on the player. &nbsp;Going into the style menu will fix this.|[Streamable Video](https://streamable.com/631fzi)|

# My Feedback
Stuff that doesn't really seem like a bug, yet it still managed to draw my attention.
|\#\#|Feedback|
|-|-|
|01|The radio station order when you scroll through 1 by 1 does not match the radio wheel order|
|02|**'Flaming Punch'** is worthless over **'Pineapple Express'** at high difficulty. &nbsp;Pineapple Express has a bunch of invulnerability frames, good damage, can damage multiple enemies, and typically does enough damage to regenerate the flow cost so it's nice and spammable. &nbsp;Flaming Punch leaves the player standing vulnerable during the wind-up, can only target one enemy, and doesn't do much damage, but it does have some style points I guess. &nbsp;This is not asking for a nerf to Pineapple Express. &nbsp;It is a single player game, I want to have fun. &nbsp;Pineapple Express is fun to abuse. &nbsp;Please make Flaming Punch fun.|
|03|Putting DLC items in the collectable list before the DLC is even out is wack. &nbsp;I must now sit and wait with this locked blemish in my collectible list. &nbsp;Also, what about people who do not plan to buy the DLC?|
|04|Locking **'Everything is a Million Dollars'** until the story line was over was confusing and made me think the shop did not even work|
|05|The save game limit is way too low. &nbsp;There shouldn't even be a limit to the amount of saves you can have. &nbsp;If there is some problem with cloud saves or something at least give me 50 saves. (please ;.;)|
|06|Allow more anti-aliasing options over FXAA which smears vaseline on the screen and TSSAA which creates visual artifacts in motion|
|07|[Please fix this](https://i.imgur.com/YlTwjFo.png)|
