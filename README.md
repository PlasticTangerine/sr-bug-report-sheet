# Saints Row Bug Report Sheet

## Foreword
This is a compilation of bugs I noticed while playing the game. &nbsp;I have been playing the game since release day with a single character I imported from the Boss Factory. &nbsp;These bugs were noticed on the Epic Games (PC) version of the game. &nbsp;All bugs were recorded on game version **1.1.6.4392638**, yet some may have been discovered on earlier versions.

Here are my system specs:
|        |                      |
|--------|----------------------|
| OS     | Windows 10 64bit     |
| CPU    | Intel i7-9700K       |
| Memory | 32GB                 |
| GPU    | GeForce RTX 2080 8GB |

Additionally, I run a tripple monitor setup, with each monitor set to 1920x1080 @ 144hz. &nbsp;The game is displayed on monitor 1. &nbsp;I used a keyboard and mouse as my input device to play the game.

Here is a video that showcases all of my in game settings: &nbsp;[Streamable Video](https://streamable.com/2al36w)
